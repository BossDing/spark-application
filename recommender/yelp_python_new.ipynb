      "Absolutely my go to AYCE sushi place! I purely judge restruants by their food, service, and ambience. My friends and I were playing pool at the Gorilla Cafe and we were told that a new sushi place just opened up a month ago. So  I definitely had to try it out because I eat sushi often and it was also my friends first time so I had to be their \"Sushi Guide.\" Let me tell you.. The sushi was AMAZING. Not very heavy on the sauce, which I like, and the common special rolls like the Dragon, Caterpillar, and the Lisa Lisa was really on top of its game compared to some other places. My friends said it was a great first experience eating sushi and we were glad it had to be that place. Expect us every other week to eat there and play pool at the cafe. \n",
      "\n",
      "I recommend Edamame and Gyoza to get started. The rolls I definitely recommend are the Philadelphia, Lisa Lisa, Caterpillar, Dragon, Mexican Fiesta, and nigiri would hands down be the Paprika Salmon.\n",

      "Sometimes in Vegas it's a pain in the ass to get to a liquor store, and the gift shops should give out a complementary bottle of lube with each alcohol purchase. It's nice to have a convenient place to get anything you need and more at a reasonable price.\n",

      "I chose this place because its close to home and very convenient.  The store is clean and the attendants are polite.  My only grip is that the service is slow.  I was the only car they were working on at the time (oil change and filter change) and it took over an hour.  I asked the guy at the counter what the hold up was and I was informed that they were waiting for my filter to arrive from another store.  Geesh.  \n",
      "\n",
      "I was irritated because before they started the work I asked how long it would take and if it was going to be a while I would just come back.  I was told it would be quick and it wasnt.  I did receive a coupon for half off my next oil change for my inconvenience.  THANK YOU for being thoughtful.  I will return again; however If the service is still slow my second visit may be my last.\n"

We had some of the best service I have ever had while dining at Pasta Cucina. Literally from beginning to end. The hostess was engaging and polite. Our server took the time to ask about us and get to know us, and the food runner was funny and entertaining. There was great energy flowing through all of them. They were a great team and we thoroughly delightful. Thank you so very much! :)\n",

      "First  when you walk in this place is so peaceful and elegantly decorated it feels like you are in a high end spa for humans! Then the tour of the facility was astounding how fresh smelling and super clean . The rooms were roomy enough for both our dogs . They also had Designer Rooms with actual queen size beds and 45' screen tv . Yet the regular rooms also had the televisions and a couch for the guests to sleep. The play areas were also super clean and the staff was super attentive to all the doggies. They even text us pictures of them playing with the other guests!!!! I was a phenomenal feeling to get these pictures , to see that our babies were having  a \"Vegas Experience\" just like we were! Thank you so much Zanetta and your Phenomenally Fantastic Staff for taking care of our Babies!!! We will be back to Vegas more now that we have found these Wonderfull People and their Amazingly Luxurious accommodations for our Babies!! If you love your Dogs their is No other place !!!\n"
